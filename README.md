Hello! This is my milestone 1 project: [reviewmeproduct.site](https://reviewmeproduct.site/)

First, find the images and icons you need. Here, I find icons on the website flaticon.com.

Once the HTML and CSS code are ready, push the code to your GitHub repository.

Next, deploy the HTML and CSS code to Netlify. Choose "add new site" and then "import an existing project."
